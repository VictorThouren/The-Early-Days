   	  <p>Welcome to the City Parks website! Explore our site to see the exciting things our department has to offer. The Parks and Recreation Division offers a wide variety of activities for each member of the family to enjoy. One of the main goals for the Division is to improve recreational opportunities for all citizens, and with the opening of new fitness centers, the construction of greenways and walking trails and the installation of new playground equipment at many city parks, great progress is being made toward the goal.</p>
