Write a program to determine the day of week a person was born, given his or her birth date. Use the following algorithm to find the day of the week corresponding to any date in the 20th century.

a. Divide the last two digits of the birth year by 4. Put the quotient (ignoring the remainder) in total.
b. Add the last two digits of the year to total.
c. Add the last two digits of the day of birth to total.
d. Use the following table to find the month number and add it to total.
January = 1 February = 4 March = 4 April = 0
May = 2 June = 5 July = 0 August = 3
September = 6 October = 1 November = 4
December = 6
e. If the year is a leap year (year mod 4 = 0) and if the month is January or February subtract 1 from total.
f. Divide total by 7 and use the remainder to find the day of the week an individual was born.
1 = Sunday 2 = Monday 3 = Tuesday 4 = Wednesday
5 = Thursday 6 = Friday 0 = Saturday


Prompt the user to enter the month, day and year of birth one at a time. Output the day of the week that the person was born.

Dates prior to 1900 and after 1999 will not work.
Display an appropriate message if the date entered is out of range.
